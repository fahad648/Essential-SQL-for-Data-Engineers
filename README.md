# Essential-SQL-for-Data-Engineers

🚀 Just wrapped up an exhilarating SQL module that took my database skills to a whole new level! 💼💾

In this intensive learning journey, we delved deep into the world of SQL and uncovered some incredible techniques and tools:

✨ **Joins** - Mastering the art of merging data from multiple tables.
✨ **Views** - Creating logical tables for simplified queries.
✨ **CTE Functions** - Streamlining complex queries with Common Table Expressions.
✨ **Window Functions** - Unleashing analytical power for dynamic results.
✨ **Delimiters** - Precision data separation techniques.
✨ **Triggers** - Automating actions when data changes.
✨ **Sub-queries** - Harnessing nested queries for advanced data manipulations.

But that's not all! Our journey culminated in an exciting assignment, where we put our skills to the test. 📚

📊 Assignment Highlights:
1️⃣ Determining order counts for each product line with more than 100 orders (Hint: We rocked the HAVING clause! 🧠)
2️⃣ Counting employees under each manager's wing (Self-join, anyone? 🤝)
3️⃣ Breaking down order counts by city and order status using CASE statements (Data transformation, nailed it! 🏙️)
4️⃣ Calculating total office orders sold and total orders sold by employees (Multiple joins and sub-queries, no problem! 🌐)
5️⃣ Identifying the 2nd highest selling product for each product line (Window Functions and CTEs to the rescue! 🏆)

But wait, there's more! In Section 2, we took our skills to another level, working with real-world data:

📈 **Database Object Creation Highlights:**
1️⃣ Created a dynamic view "complaints_last_3_months_sum" to analyze complaints received in the last three months, breaking them down by various attributes like state, product, issue, sub-product, and sub-issue.
2️⃣ Crafted a smart procedure to migrate data from the original table to another table for complaints received in the last 3 months, based on a flexible date parameter.
3️⃣ Implemented a trigger to automatically update the "complaints_last_3_months" table whenever new records are inserted into the original financial consumer complaints table within the last 3 months.

What a journey it has been! Our SQL skills are now finely honed, ready to tackle real-world challenges with confidence. 🌟 Can't wait to see where these newfound skills take us next! 💪💼 #SQLMaster #DatabaseMagic #SkillsUnlocked #RealWorldSQL #DataMastery
